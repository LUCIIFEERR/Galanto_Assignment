# Wrist Movement Rehabilitation Game

## Overview

This game is designed to assist in wrist rehabilitation for a 35-year-old patient suffering from restricted wrist movement. The game simulates kitchen chores, specifically chopping fruits and vegetables, using simple wrist-like motions. The game tracks the player’s progress by allowing them to slice and move chopped pieces aside.

## Features

- A simple kitchen environment where the player can chop vegetables.
- Vegetables can be sliced using up/down movements controlled by the keyboard.
- Use side keys to slide the chopped pieces aside, mimicking wrist movement exercises.
- Realistic slicing mechanics using **EzySlice**.
- Simple physics to simulate the natural movement of sliced pieces.

## Tools Used

- **Unity 3D**: Used as the game engine to build the entire application.
- **C#**: Programming language used for scripting the game logic.
- **Blender**: Used to model the 3D assets (vegetables, knife, etc.).
- **EzySlice**: Library for implementing dynamic object slicing.

## How to Play

1. Use the **Up/Down** arrow keys to control the knife’s vertical movement.
2. Use the **Side** arrow keys to move sliced pieces aside.
3. Aim to slice the vegetables cleanly and watch them fall naturally thanks to the physics system.

## Installation

1. Download the game APK or executable file from the provided link.
2. Install the game on your Android device or run it on your PC.
3. Start the game and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Challenges Faced

- Implementing realistic slicing mechanics using EzySlice.
- Ensuring sliced objects retained their textures and proper UV mappings.
- Adding natural physics to simulate the behavior of sliced vegetable pieces.

## Future Enhancements

- More vegetable types and tasks for increased variety.
- Progress tracking to motivate the player by showing improvement over time.
- Scoring system to provide immediate feedback on slicing accuracy.
